## Presentations

Presentations a grouped by events in descending order.

## Liszt processing (Raphael Sousa Santos) (2017-07-20)

We'll take a look at a prototype for a language and interactive environment for
computer assisted music composition and analysis implemented in Common Lisp.
After an initial overview, we'll walk through its implementation and motivate
it from a user's perspective.

## Common lisp, good parts (Dmitry Petrov) (2017-05-01)

In this quick talk I'll try to assemble some languages feature that I found
really powerful or unusual comparing to mainstream languages

## Stu; understanding “code is data is code” (Michael Austin) (2017-05-01)

The above mantra is fundamental to the lisp philosophy, but what does it mean
in more tangible terms? I will describe the beginnings of stu, a lisp dialect
made from first principles in order to explore this concept.

## Red language overview (Maxim Velesyuk) (2017-05-01)

Red looks to the “code is data” idea from a different angle, in combination
with modern techniques and high quality engineering makes it very powerful and
practical language. We’ll take a look at Red in this talk.
